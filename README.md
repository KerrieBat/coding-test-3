### The Challenge

##Static site or single-page app

Using any language/framework, build a static, generated site or single-page application for a

fictitious government org of your own design.

At a minimum, it should:

have the standard retinue of about, faq, contact, etc. pages (with ipsum text is fine)

have some multimedia

implement a multi-step webform

and

have a reasonable "DX" (Developer Experience)

Feel free to use whatever technology you want. Just make sure to use it well!


### The Submission

For a ficticious government org I immediately wanted to do something about my favourite place, the beach. I thought of Coast Care, only to find that it already existed (probably why it sounded familiar!), but the website for the Victorian Govermment CoastCare intiative is ugly. I decided to rewrite the site. So my site has some words and a video from the original site. The photos, layout, look and feel are all new.


### Tech used

-Node.js
  -body-parser
  -ejs
  -express
-jQuery
-Bootstrap


### Installation

npm Install

npm start server.js


### Operation

at localhost:3000 in the browser


### Discussion

The framework is setup, the pages are responsive, the data is not being saved and is not being used at this stage. I think the new site is a lot more appealing. This does meet the challenge requirements.
