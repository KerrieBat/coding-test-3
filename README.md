### The Challenge

##Static site or single-page app

Using any language/framework, build a static, generated site or single-page application for a

fictitious government org of your own design.

At a minimum, it should:

have the standard retinue of about, faq, contact, etc. pages (with ipsum text is fine)

have some multimedia

implement a multi-step webform

and

have a reasonable "DX" (Developer Experience)

Feel free to use whatever technology you want. Just make sure to use it well!


### The Submission

For a ficticious government org I immediately wanted to do something about my favourite place, the beach. I thought of Coast Care, only to find that it already existed, but the website for the Victorian Govermment CoastCare intiative is ugly. I decided to rewrite the site. So my site has some words and a video from the original site. The photos, layout, look and feel are all new.
